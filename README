# Reach CMS

Reach is my playground for trying out new things - new code patterns, new platforms, new beer, et al. The core philosophy is loosely based on using a distributed pipeline execution pattern for managing content for a website. In layman's terms - the business logic that goes into CRUDing content for a website can run on a single server or several servers, and this is kept separate from using the generated data (views).

## Reach Elements

Projects bearing the "Elements" naming pertain to reusable Blazor Components meant for developing the core toolset of the Reach platform.

## Reach core

Contains the common use, platform level classes used to run Reach code.
